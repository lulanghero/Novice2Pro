[简体中文](./README.md) | English

## 1. Project Overview

**Novice2Pror** is an open-source educational and incentive-oriented intelligent agent platform designed for beginners and growing developers.  
Based on GitHub behavior logs and OpenDigger metric data, the project leverages AI Agent technologies to provide developers with:

- Open source project and task recommendations  
- Data-driven learning path planning  
- Explainable incentive mechanisms and growth feedback

## 2. Competition Topic and Data Sources

- Competition: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} Open Source Digital Ecosystem Analysis and Application Innovation Competition  
- Topic Direction: Open Source Education and Open Source Incentives  
- Data Sources:
  - ContentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} Global Logs (January 2020)

## 3. Core Problem Definition

Common challenges faced by open source beginners include:

- Not knowing which projects to start with  
- Inability to judge whether a project is “beginner-friendly”  
- Slow feedback on contributions, leading to easy dropout  
- Lack of a systematic growth path  

This project aims to address these issues through data-driven and intelligent agent technologies.
